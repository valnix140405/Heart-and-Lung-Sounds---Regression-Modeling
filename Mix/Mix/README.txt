This zip file contains 3*145 recordings of mixed sounds along their heart and lung sound source, captured using a digital stethoscope from a clinical manikin. The dataset includes both individual and mixed recordings of heart and lung sounds, as well as normal and abnormal sounds, recorded from various anatomical chest locations.

Dataset Composition:
Heart Sounds: 50 recordings
Lung Sounds: 50 recordings
Mixed Heart and Lung Sounds: 3*145 recordings

Each recording has been processed with specific filters to enhance either heart or lung sounds. This dataset is highly valuable for research in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated cardiopulmonary disease detection, sound classification, and deep learning algorithms for audio signal processing.
